 Note for importing scalefs to mvcc-os

 * General approach
  - Sv6 and Scalefs are not compiled on up-to-date ubuntu os but Ward which is based on sv6 works

 1) Makefile
  - change include paths
  - change c++ version to c++17


 2) copy thirdparty header
  - copied from ward which is a research os based on sv6
