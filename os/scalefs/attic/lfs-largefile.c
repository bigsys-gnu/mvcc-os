/*
 * lfs-largefile.c
 *
 * Implementation of the test described in Figure 9 of Rosenblum's LFS paper
 * ("The Design and Implementation of a Log-Structured File System", 13th
 * SOSP, 1991).
 *
 * "The figure shows the speed of a benchmark that creates a 100MB file with 
 * sequential writes, then reads the file back sequentially, then writes 
 * 100MB randomly to the existing file, then reads 100MB randomly from the
 * file, and finally reads the file sequentially again.  The bandwidth of
 * each of the of the five phases is shown separately."
 *
 * Unfortunately the description of the benchmark does not provide all of the
 * information required to reproduce.  It does not specify the size of
 * I/O operation used.  I allow this to be specified as a command line 
 * argument, so that we can play with different sizes easily.  They also
 * don't define the way the randomly read/write the file.  Do the 100MB of
 * random reads read each byte of the file once, or are they completely 
 * random?  My first implementation used the latter, this uses the former.
 *
 * Usage:
 *      lfs-largefile [-f file_size] [-i IO_size] [-s seed] dirname
 *
 * The test creates a test file in dirname.  file_size specifies the size
 * of the file in megabytes (defaults to 100).  IO_size specifies the size
 * of the IO transfers in kilobytes (defaults to 256).
